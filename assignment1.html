			  <h1>Wind power</h1>
			  <p><strong>Wind power</strong> is the use of <em>air flow</em> through wind turbines to mechanically power generators for electric power. Wind power, as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, consumes no water, and uses little land.[2] The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of nonrenewable power sources.</p>



        <p>Wind farms consist of many individual <strong>wind turbines</strong> which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants.[3][4][5] Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide <em>electric power</em> to isolated off-grid locations.[6]</p>

		   <h2>History</h2>
				<p>Wind power has been used as long as humans have put <em>sails</em> into the wind. For more than two millennia wind-powered machines have ground grain and pumped water. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. <strong>Wind-powered pumps</strong> drained the polders of the Netherlands, and in arid regions such as the American mid-west or the Australian outback, wind pumps provided water for live stock and steam engines.</p>
