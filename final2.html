		<p>Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.

	 Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves,nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.[1]

	 Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions,
	 such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are
		countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate,
		 and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated
			procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making
			 (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions
				have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.

  <h4 id="h4">Types</h4>
	 <p>Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.</p>
	 <p> A classic pound cake is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Baking powder is in many butter cakes, such as Victoria sponge.[12] The ingredients are sometimes mixed without creaming the butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes.</p>
<p>Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added as insurance.
	 Sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast. An angel food cake is a white sponge cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan. The French GÃ©noise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau; the French word for cake.</p>
	<p> Chiffon cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.[13]</p>
<p>Chocolate cakes are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or cocoa powder.[14] German chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake. Fudge cakes are chocolate cakes that contains fudge.</p>
<p>Coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or at a coffee break. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.
