		<h1 id="h1">Cold</h1>
	<p>The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose.[7] The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected.[5] Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure.[5] They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever.[2][3] People usually recover in seven to ten days.[2] Some symptoms may last up to three weeks.[6] In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.[2]

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common.[10] They spread through the air during close contact with infected people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose.[2] Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress.[5] Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves.[11] People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former.[5] Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.[12]

There is no vaccine for the common cold.[2] The primary methods of prevention are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people.[2] Some evidence supports the use of face masks.[13] No cure for the common cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated.[2] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain.[8] Antibiotics should not be used.[14] Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.[5]

The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans.[15]
 The average adult gets two to four colds a year, while the average child may
  get six to eight.[9] They occur more commonly during the winter.(Wikipedia,'cold')

<h2 id="h2">prevention</h2>
<p>The only useful ways to reduce the spread of cold viruses are physical measures[13] such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used.[13] Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly.[13] Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.[54]

Regular hand washing appears to be effective in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children.[55] Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown.[55] Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.[55]

Zinc supplements may help to reduce the frequency of colds.[56][57] Routine vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk or severity of the common cold, though they may reduce its duration.[58] Gargling with water was found useful in one small trial.[59]
