<h2 id="big1">History</h2>
<p id="small1">Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
  [7][8] observed most commonly on December 25[4][9][10] as a religious and
   cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][11][12]
    A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the
     season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of
      Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
       culminates on Twelfth Night;[13] in some traditions, Christmastide
        includes an Octave.[14] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of
         the world's nations,[15][16][17] is celebrated religiously by a
          majority of Christians,[18] as well as culturally by many
           non-Christians,[1][19] and forms an integral part of the holiday
            season. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve has the
             main focus rather than Christmas Day.Although the month and date
              of Jesus' birth are unknown, by the early-to-mid fourth century
               the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December
                25,[20] a date that was later adopted in the East.[21][22]
                 Today, most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the
                  Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally
                   in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the
                    world. However, some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate
                     Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar,
                      which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian
                       calendar, the day after the Western Christian Church
                        celebrates the Epiphany. This is not a disagreement
                         over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a
                          preference of which calendar should be used to
                           determine the day that is December 25.</p>

<h3 id="big2">Decoration</h3>
<p id="small2">The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation
  of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice,
  which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree
   worship;[163] according to eighth-century biographer Æddi Stephanus,
    Saint Boniface (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe
    to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree,
    which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because
     it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said
     was symbolic of the Trinity.[164] The English language phrase
      "Christmas tree" is first recorded in 1835[165]
       and represents an importation from the German language.
       The modern Christmas tree tradition is believed to have begun
        in Germany in the 18th century[163] though many argue that Martin Luther
         began the tradition in the 16th century.[166][167]From Germany
          the custom was introduced to Britain, first via Queen Charlotte,
           wife of George III, and then more successfully by Prince Albert
            during the reign of Queen Victoria. By 1841 the Christmas tree
             had become even more widespread throughout Britain.[129]
              By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom
               of putting up a Christmas tree.[130] Christmas trees may be
                decorated with lights and ornaments.(Wikipedia,'Christmas')</p>

<h4 id="big3"> Santa Clauses</h4>
<p id="small3"> The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus,
  of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the
  Dutch Sinterklaas, which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas
   was a 4th-century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman
    province of Lycia, whose ruins are 3 kilometres (1.9 mi)
     from modern Demre in southwest Turkey.[184][185] Among other saintly
      attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity,
       and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be
        celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.[99]
